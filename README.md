  ## Description
  This is a personal project for an independent game publisher. I am making this as a portfolio piece whilst attempting to learn near React technologies, such as React-bootstrap for a carousel and learning to create a music player.

  ## Installation
  once you've forked/downloaded to repo, open your local code editor and type npm run build in terminal. After React has finished building, then type npm run start. This will fire off the site. 
  
  ## Usage
  Currently this app has no functional features, as this is a dev build that has the relative container position/order I want them in.
